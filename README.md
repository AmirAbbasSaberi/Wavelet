# Wavelet

If our ear uses a certain technique to analyze a signal, then if you use that same math-
ematical technique, you will be doing something like our ear. You might miss important
things, but you would miss things that our ear would miss too.

The mathematical analysis of the frequency content of signals is called Fourier analysis.
analysis as it applies to discrete signals and use it to analyze the frequency content of wavelets.
A deeper understanding of wavelets can be gained from studying their frequency content, and
by examining how this frequency content relates to wavelet transforms of signals.
To understand better the mathematics as simple as possible we shall focus on 1D signals.then
we concetrate on photos(2D signals).The main Philosophy of generating of wavelet is defects
in Statical feature of time or space Fourier analysis.
